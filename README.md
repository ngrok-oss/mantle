# Mantle

[Mantle](https://mantle.ngrok.com) is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)’s UI library and design system. It’s based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) providing styling. It’s documented using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

### Installation

Mantle uses `pnpm` as its package manager. First, install the dependencies in the repo’s directory by running `pnpm install`.

### Development and preview

It’s likely easiest to run `pnpm start` to run Storybook’s development mode. Storybook will listen to file changes and refresh the browser window it launched as needed.
