# @ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins

Vite plugins for apps built with [`@ngrok/mantle`](https://github.com/ngrok-oss/mantle).

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- Vite 5+
- `@ngrok/mantle` installed in the same project

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add -D -E @ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins
```

## Plugins

### `mantleSourcePlugin`

Injects Tailwind CSS `@source` directives into your global CSS file for only the mantle components your app actually imports, reducing generated CSS bundle size with no manual maintenance.

#### When to use

Mantle ships `source-all.css` as the zero-configuration option — a single `@source` that covers every component in the package:

```css
@import "@ngrok/mantle/mantle.css";
@import "@ngrok/mantle/source-all.css";
```

Use `mantleSourcePlugin` instead when your app uses a subset of mantle components and you want the smallest possible CSS output. The plugin scans your source files, detects which components you import, and writes targeted `@source` directives for only those components.

| Approach             | When to use                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source-all.css`     | Your app uses most or all mantle components, or you want zero build tooling configuration. |
| `mantleSourcePlugin` | Your app uses a subset of mantle components and you want the smallest possible CSS output. |

If you are unsure, start with `source-all.css`.

#### Setup

**1. Add the plugin to `vite.config.ts`:**

```ts
import { mantleSourcePlugin } from "@ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [mantleSourcePlugin()],
});
```

**2. In your global CSS, import `mantle.css` without `source-all.css`:**

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@ngrok/mantle/mantle.css";
/* do NOT add @import "@ngrok/mantle/source-all.css" */
```

That is all. The plugin writes the correct `@source` lines into your CSS file before `@tailwindcss/vite` processes it.

#### Options

| Option    | Type       | Default                                                                               | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include` | `string[]` | `["src"]`                                                                             | Directories to scan recursively for `@ngrok/mantle/*` imports. Paths are relative to the Vite project root. |
| `cssFile` | `string`   | First of `app/global.css`, `src/global.css`, `app/app.css`, `src/app.css` that exists | Path to the CSS file to inject `@source` directives into. Relative to the Vite project root, or absolute.   |

#### How it works

1. **`configResolved`** — After Vite resolves its configuration, the plugin locates `@ngrok/mantle`'s `dist/` directory via `require.resolve`, then walks the directories in `include` scanning every `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mdx`, and `.md` file for `@ngrok/mantle/<name>` import statements. It writes a clearly-marked block of `@source` directives directly into the target CSS file on disk, immediately after the last `@import` line. The write is idempotent — the file is only touched when the content would actually change.

2. **`configureServer`** — In development, the plugin watches your source files via Vite's built-in file watcher. When a file change introduces a mantle import for a component not previously detected, the CSS file is updated in place and Tailwind's own watcher picks up the change automatically — no server restart required.

**Why write to disk:** `@tailwindcss/vite` reads CSS files from disk at dev-server startup to initialize its file-system scanner and set up watchers, before Vite's `transform` pipeline runs. Injecting `@source` via a `transform` hook works in production builds but is invisible to Tailwind's dev-mode scanner. Writing to disk ensures the directives are present when Tailwind first reads the file.

#### The generated block

The plugin writes a deterministic, human-readable block that is safe to commit:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@ngrok/mantle/mantle.css";

/* @ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins:source:start */
@source "../node_modules/@ngrok/mantle/dist/button.js";
@source "../node_modules/@ngrok/mantle/dist/input.js";
/* @ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins:source:end */
```

To remove it, delete the lines between the `source:start` and `source:end` markers, or remove the plugin from your Vite config and it will be cleaned up on the next build.

## TypeScript

Type declarations are included. No `@types/*` package is needed.
