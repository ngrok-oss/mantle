/**
 * Vite plugin that scans your app's source files for `@ngrok/mantle/*` component
 * imports and injects Tailwind CSS `@source` directives into your global CSS file
 * for only those components — so Tailwind only scans the mantle components your
 * app actually uses.
 *
 * By default, Tailwind must scan every compiled mantle component to discover
 * which utility classes are used. This plugin scans your app's source files,
 * finds which mantle components you import, and writes targeted `@source`
 * directives into your CSS file so Tailwind only scans those components.
 * The result is a smaller generated CSS bundle.
 *
 * The directives are written **directly to disk** inside a clearly-marked
 * auto-generated block. This ensures Tailwind's file-system scanner sees
 * them in both dev and prod — unlike a Vite `transform` hook, which is only
 * visible to Vite's in-memory pipeline and is ignored by Tailwind's dev-mode
 * scanner.
 *
 * In development, the plugin watches your source files for new mantle imports
 * AND intercepts Vite's module resolution to catch imports from workspace
 * packages that are outside the scanned `include` directories. When a new
 * component import is detected, the CSS file is updated in place and
 * Tailwind's watcher picks up the change automatically — no server restart
 * required.
 *
 * **Setup**
 *
 * 1. Add the plugin to `vite.config.ts`:
 *    ```ts
 *    import { mantleTwSourcePlugin } from "@ngrok/mantle-vite-plugins";
 *
 *    export default defineConfig({
 *      plugins: [mantleTwSourcePlugin()],
 *    });
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. In your global CSS, import `mantle.css` — do **not** add `source-all.css`:
 *    ```css
 *    @import "@ngrok/mantle/mantle.css";
 *    ```
 *
 * The plugin writes the correct `@source` lines into your CSS file so Tailwind
 * picks them up on startup in both dev and prod.
 *
 * @param options - Optional configuration. See {@link MantleTwSourcePluginOptions}.
 * @returns A Vite plugin object.
