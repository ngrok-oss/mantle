						<h2>Why Philosophy Matters</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						A clear philosophy guides every decision in Mantle's design and
						implementation. It ensures consistency across components, helps
						developers understand the "why" behind design choices, and provides
						a foundation for making decisions about new features and
						improvements.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						From choosing to build on semantic HTML foundations to selecting
						primitive libraries that prioritize accessibility, every
						architectural decision in Mantle reflects our commitment to creating
						a design system that works for everyone, everywhere.
					</p>

						id="composition-over-configuration"

					>
						<h2>Composition Over Configuration</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle embraces the power of composition by building on proven
						primitives rather than reinventing the wheel. We compose around
						established, unstyled primitive component libraries like{" "}
						<Anchor href="https://www.radix-ui.com">Radix UI</Anchor>,{" "}
						<Anchor href="https://ariakit.org">Ariakit</Anchor>, and{" "}
						<Anchor href="https://headlessui.com">Headless UI</Anchor>.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This approach gives us the best of both worlds: robust, accessible
						functionality from battle-tested libraries, combined with ngrok's
						unique visual design language. Components can be composed together
						naturally, and the <Code>asChild</Code> pattern allows for deep
						composition when needed.
					</p>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="semantic-markup-first"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Semantic Markup First</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle starts with semantic HTML as the foundation for every
						component. We believe that the right HTML element for the job should
						always be the starting point, not an afterthought. This means using{" "}
						<Code>&lt;button&gt;</Code> elements for buttons,{" "}
						<Code>&lt;input&gt;</Code> elements for form controls, and proper
						heading hierarchy for content structure.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Semantic markup provides a solid foundation that works across all
						devices, assistive technologies, and contexts—even when CSS fails to
						load or JavaScript is disabled. It ensures that our components are
						meaningful to screen readers, search engines, and other tools that
						parse HTML structure.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						By starting with the right semantic elements, we get keyboard
						navigation, focus management, and screen reader compatibility for
						free. This approach reduces the amount of custom accessibility code
						needed and ensures that our components behave predictably across
						different environments.
					</p>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="progressive-enhancement"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle progressively enhances standard DOM elements, improving
						usability and accessibility while filling functional gaps. Rather
						than creating entirely new paradigms, we build upon familiar HTML
						patterns that developers already understand.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This means our components work as you'd expect them to, with
						additional features layered on top. A{" "}
						<Link to={href("/components/button")}>Button</Link> is still a
						button, but with enhanced styling, loading states, and accessibility
						features.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="developer-experience"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Developer Experience is Key</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle prioritizes developer ergonomics through strong TypeScript
						typing, clear APIs, and comprehensive documentation. We believe that
						good developer experience leads to better user experiences.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Every component is built with TypeScript from the ground up,
						providing rich IntelliSense, compile-time safety, and clear
						contracts. Variant props are strongly typed, and the component APIs
						are designed to be intuitive and consistent across the entire
						library.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="accessibility-first"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Accessibility First</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Accessibility isn't an afterthought in Mantle—it's built into the
						foundation. By starting with semantic HTML and leveraging primitives
						that already implement WAI-ARIA patterns correctly, we ensure that
						every component works well with screen readers, keyboard navigation,
						and other assistive technologies.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Our commitment to semantic markup means that components are
						inherently accessible. A properly structured{" "}
						<Link to={href("/components/button")}>Button</Link> component works
						with screen readers because it's built on a real{" "}
						<Code>&lt;button&gt;</Code> element, not a styled{" "}
						<Code>&lt;div&gt;</Code> with click handlers.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This approach means that ngrok's applications are usable by
						everyone, regardless of their abilities or how they interact with
						the web. It also ensures compliance with web standards and
						accessibility guidelines without requiring extensive additional
						work.

					<HashLinkHeading
						id="tailwind-as-design-language"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Tailwind as Design Language</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle uses{" "}
						<Anchor href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</Anchor> as both
						a styling solution and a design language. Our custom{" "}
						<Link to={href("/base/tailwind-variants")}>Tailwind preset</Link>{" "}
						defines ngrok's design tokens—colors, spacing, typography, and
						more—in a way that's both consistent and flexible.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This approach allows developers to extend components naturally using
						familiar utility classes, while ensuring that custom styling still
						adheres to the design system. The design tokens are semantic,
						meaning they adapt to different themes and contexts automatically.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="type-safety-without-complexity"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Type Safety Without Complexity</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						While Mantle is built with TypeScript, we avoid forcing developers
						to wrestle with complex generics or internal types. Instead, we
						leverage TypeScript's type inference to provide excellent
						development experience with minimal cognitive overhead.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Component variants are typed using{" "}
						<Code>class-variance-authority</Code>, providing autocomplete and
						validation for styling options without requiring explicit type
						annotations. This gives you the benefits of strong typing while
						keeping the API approachable.
					</p>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="modular-architecture"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Modular Architecture</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle is designed with modularity in mind. Each component can be
						imported individually, reducing bundle size and allowing teams to
						adopt the design system incrementally. The modular export pattern
						means you only pay for what you use.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This architecture also makes it easy to extend or customize
						components for specific use cases without affecting the rest of the
						system. Teams can build their own abstractions on top of Mantle's
						primitives while maintaining consistency with the broader design
						system.
					</p>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="performance-by-default"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Performance by Default</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle components are optimized for performance out of the box. By
						using efficient styling approaches, minimizing re-renders, and
						leveraging React's built-in optimizations, we ensure that using
						Mantle doesn't compromise your application's performance.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						The component library is tree-shakable, TypeScript compilation is
						optimized, and runtime performance is a key consideration in every
						architectural decision. We believe that good performance is a
						feature, not an optimization.
					</p>

					<HashLinkHeading
						id="evolution-not-revolution"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Evolution, Not Revolution</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Mantle is designed to evolve with ngrok's needs and the broader web
						platform. We prefer evolutionary improvements over revolutionary
						changes, ensuring that existing code continues to work as the design
						system grows.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This philosophy extends to our approach to web standards, framework
						compatibility, and API design. We build on stable foundations and
						evolve thoughtfully, prioritizing long-term maintainability over
						short-term convenience.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<HashLinkHeading
						id="consistent-mental-models"
						className="text-3xl font-medium"
					>
						<h2>Consistent Mental Models</h2>
					</HashLinkHeading>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						Across all of Mantle's components, we maintain consistent mental
						models and naming conventions. If you understand how one component
						works, you can reasonably predict how others will behave.
					</p>
					<p className="font-body text-body mt-3">
						This consistency extends to prop names, variant patterns, event
						handling, and composition patterns. Learning Mantle once means
						understanding the entire system, reducing the cognitive load on
						developers and making the codebase more maintainable.
