Mantle is <Anchor href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</Anchor>'s UI library and design system that
powers its front-end.

## Overview

Mantle is a carefully designed system of [React](https://react.dev) components and utilities
that establishes a unified design language and consistent user experience across ngrok's web
applications. Built with flexibility, extensibility, and developer ergonomics in mind, Mantle
prioritizes accessibility, performance, and long-term maintainability. Developed in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it offers strong typing, rich IDE support, and
increased confidence through compile-time safety. Mantle empowers ngrok's developers to craft
interfaces that align seamlessly with the company's brand, design principles, and engineering
standards. By progressively enhancing standard DOM elements, it not only improves usability and
accessibility, but also fills functional gaps—providing a robust foundation for building
cohesive, modern UIs throughout the platform.

All of Mantle's components are styled using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). and we compose
around the following unstyled primitive component libraries:

- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com)
- [Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/components)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)

Mantle uses [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) as the primary icon library, providing
a versatile and consistent set of icons. In addition, custom-designed icons tailored to ngrok's
needs are available through the [`@ngrok/mantle/icons`](/components/icons) module.

### Status

Mantle is a work in progress that's currently adding components. It intends to replace new and
existing ngrok user interfaces.

Mantle is available in its alpha state on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngrok/mantle). It
is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ngrok-oss/mantle).
