The design principles and architectural decisions that guide Mantle's development, ensuring a
consistent, accessible, and maintainable design system.

## Why Philosophy Matters

A clear philosophy guides every decision in Mantle's design and implementation. It
ensures consistency across components, helps developers understand the "why" behind
design choices, and provides a foundation for making decisions about new features and
improvements.

From choosing to build on semantic HTML foundations to selecting primitive libraries
that prioritize accessibility, every architectural decision in Mantle reflects our
commitment to creating a design system that works for everyone, everywhere.

## Composition Over Configuration

Mantle embraces the power of composition by building on proven primitives rather than
reinventing the wheel. We compose around established, unstyled primitive component
libraries like [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com), [Ariakit](https://ariakit.org),
and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com).

This approach gives us the best of both worlds: robust, accessible functionality from
battle-tested libraries, combined with ngrok's unique visual design language. Components
can be composed together naturally, and the `asChild` pattern allows for deep
composition when needed.

## Semantic Markup First

Mantle starts with semantic HTML as the foundation for every component. We believe that
the right HTML element for the job should always be the starting point, not an
afterthought. This means using `<button>` elements for buttons, `<input>` elements for
form controls, and proper heading hierarchy for content structure.

Semantic markup provides a solid foundation that works across all devices, assistive
technologies, and contexts—even when CSS fails to load or JavaScript is disabled. It
ensures that our components are meaningful to screen readers, search engines, and other
tools that parse HTML structure.

By starting with the right semantic elements, we get keyboard navigation, focus
management, and screen reader compatibility for free. This approach reduces the amount
of custom accessibility code needed and ensures that our components behave predictably
across different environments.

## Progressive Enhancement

Mantle progressively enhances standard DOM elements, improving usability and
accessibility while filling functional gaps. Rather than creating entirely new
paradigms, we build upon familiar HTML patterns that developers already understand.

This means our components work as you'd expect them to, with additional features layered
on top. A [Button](/components/button) is still a button, but with enhanced styling,
loading states, and accessibility features.

## Developer Experience is Key

Mantle prioritizes developer ergonomics through strong TypeScript typing, clear APIs,
and comprehensive documentation. We believe that good developer experience leads to
better user experiences.

Every component is built with TypeScript from the ground up, providing rich
IntelliSense, compile-time safety, and clear contracts. Variant props are strongly
typed, and the component APIs are designed to be intuitive and consistent across the
entire library.

## Accessibility First

Accessibility isn't an afterthought in Mantle—it's built into the foundation. By
starting with semantic HTML and leveraging primitives that already implement WAI-ARIA
patterns correctly, we ensure that every component works well with screen readers,
keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.

Our commitment to semantic markup means that components are inherently accessible. A
properly structured [Button](/components/button) component works
with screen readers because it's built on a real `<button>` element,
not a styled `<div>` with click handlers.

This approach means that ngrok's applications are usable by everyone, regardless of
their abilities or how they interact with the web. It also ensures compliance with web
standards and accessibility guidelines without requiring extensive additional work.

## Tailwind as Design Language

Mantle uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as both a
styling solution and a design language. Our custom
[Tailwind preset](/base/tailwind-variants) defines ngrok's design
tokens—colors, spacing, typography, and more—in a way that's both consistent and
flexible.

This approach allows developers to extend components naturally using familiar utility
classes, while ensuring that custom styling still adheres to the design system. The
design tokens are semantic, meaning they adapt to different themes and contexts
automatically.

## Type Safety Without Complexity

While Mantle is built with TypeScript, we avoid forcing developers to wrestle with
complex generics or internal types. Instead, we leverage TypeScript's type inference to
provide excellent development experience with minimal cognitive overhead.

Component variants are typed using `class-variance-authority`, providing
autocomplete and validation for styling options without requiring explicit type
annotations. This gives you the benefits of strong typing while keeping the API
approachable.

## Modular Architecture

Mantle is designed with modularity in mind. Each component can be imported individually,
reducing bundle size and allowing teams to adopt the design system incrementally. The
modular export pattern means you only pay for what you use.

This architecture also makes it easy to extend or customize components for specific use
cases without affecting the rest of the system. Teams can build their own abstractions
on top of Mantle's primitives while maintaining consistency with the broader design
system.

## Performance by Default

Mantle components are optimized for performance out of the box. By using efficient
styling approaches, minimizing re-renders, and leveraging React's built-in
optimizations, we ensure that using Mantle doesn't compromise your application's
performance.

The component library is tree-shakable, TypeScript compilation is optimized, and runtime
performance is a key consideration in every architectural decision. We believe that good
performance is a feature, not an optimization.

## Evolution, Not Revolution

Mantle is designed to evolve with ngrok's needs and the broader web platform. We prefer
evolutionary improvements over revolutionary changes, ensuring that existing code
continues to work as the design system grows.

This philosophy extends to our approach to web standards, framework compatibility, and
API design. We build on stable foundations and evolve thoughtfully, prioritizing
long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

## Consistent Mental Models

Across all of Mantle's components, we maintain consistent mental models and naming
conventions. If you understand how one component works, you can reasonably predict how
others will behave.

This consistency extends to prop names, variant patterns, event handling, and
composition patterns. Learning Mantle once means understanding the entire system,
reducing the cognitive load on developers and making the codebase more maintainable.
