Every architectural decision in Mantle traces back to a simple premise: start with the
web platform, then layer on just enough abstraction to make it great. These principles
guide what we build, how we build it, and—just as importantly—what we choose not to build.

## Composition Over Configuration

Mantle composes around established, unstyled primitive libraries—[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com),
[Ariakit](https://ariakit.org), and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com)—rather than
reinventing interaction patterns from scratch. This gives us battle-tested accessibility
and behavior paired with ngrok's visual design language.

Components compose naturally with each other and with your own code. The `asChild`
pattern lets you swap the rendered element entirely, so Mantle never forces you into a
particular DOM structure. Configuration props handle the common case; composition
handles everything else.

## Semantic HTML, Then Everything Else

The right HTML element is always the starting point. A [Button](/components/button) renders
a `<button>`, not a styled `<div>` with click handlers. Form controls use `<input>`. Headings
follow a proper hierarchy. This isn't pedantic—it's practical.

Semantic markup gives you keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader
support for free. It works when CSS fails to load and when JavaScript is disabled. It
means every Mantle component is inherently accessible, compliant with WAI-ARIA patterns,
and meaningful to assistive technologies, search engines, and any tool that parses HTML.

From that foundation, Mantle progressively enhances. A button is still a button—but with
loading states, icon slots, and variant styling layered on top. The underlying element
always does the heavy lifting.

## Tailwind as Design Language

Mantle uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as both its styling engine and its
design language. A custom theme defines ngrok's design tokens—colors, spacing,
typography—as semantic values that adapt automatically across themes and contexts.

Because the tokens are expressed as Tailwind utilities, developers extend components
with the same vocabulary they already know. Custom styling stays on-system by default.
There's no separate theming API to learn and no abstraction boundary between Mantle's
styles and yours.

## Developer Ergonomics

Every component is built with TypeScript, but Mantle avoids exposing complex generics or
internal type machinery. Type inference does the work: variant props autocomplete
through `class-variance-authority`, contracts are enforced at compile time, and the
API surface stays small enough to hold in your head.

Consistency reinforces this. Prop names, variant patterns, event handling, and
composition patterns are uniform across the library. If you understand how one Mantle
component works, you can predict how the rest behave. Learn the system once; apply it
everywhere.

## Ship Less, Ship Better

Mantle is tree-shakable and modularly exported—you pay for only what you import. Teams
can adopt the design system incrementally, one component at a time, without pulling in
the entire library.

Runtime performance is a design constraint, not an afterthought. Components minimize
re-renders, avoid unnecessary DOM nodes, and lean on the browser's native capabilities
wherever possible. The fastest code is the code that never runs, and the most
reliable code is the code that doesn't exist.

## Evolution, Not Revolution

Mantle evolves with ngrok's needs and the broader web platform. We favor incremental
improvements over sweeping rewrites, so existing code continues to work as the system
grows.

This applies equally to API design, framework compatibility, and adoption of new web
standards. Stable foundations and thoughtful migration paths beat short-term convenience
every time.
