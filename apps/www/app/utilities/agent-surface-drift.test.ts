/**
 * Drift guard for the agent-facing component surface served at
 * `/api/components.json`.
 *
 * The committed `__snapshots__/components-surface.json` file is *generated*
 * from each component's docs frontmatter and source JSDoc (summary + every
 * `@example` block) — never hand-edited. It is the source-of-truth shape of
 * the structured surface agents consume, so a change to a component's docs,
 * summary, or examples that isn't reflected here means the two have drifted.
 *
 * Regenerate after intentional changes:
 *
 *     pnpm -F @app/www test -u
 *
 * CI's "Vibe Check" runs `vitest` without `-u`, so any un-regenerated change
 * fails this test. Volatile fields (`version`, absolute `docsUrl`/
 * `markdownUrl`) are dropped — they're derivable from `slug` + the published
 * version — so the snapshot only churns on real content changes, not on
 * version bumps.
